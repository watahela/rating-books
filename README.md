Building a second brain (was reading in eng): 7/10
  It's kind of good, but there's a lot of blah blah blah. However, there are some valuable concepts that you might consider reading about.

In progress:
1. Das große Buch vom Schlaf by Dr.med. Matthew Walker (it probably was writen in english but I wanna read it in german (by Annika Tschöpe)) - I'm hella worried about Alzheimer.
2. Beej's Guide to Network Programming (ru - originally in eng)
3. Prog intro by stolyarov (ru - original)
